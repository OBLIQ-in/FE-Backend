The root layout keeps the dashboard mounted across routes. Route pages validate the URL; the dashboard selects the corresponding screen from the pathname. Unknown sections render Next.js's 404 page. This lets the v1 timer continue during navigation without a context provider or state library.

## Data flow

`useWorkspace` loads records through `WorkspaceSource`. The local implementation reads each browser collection only after its record validator passes. Invalid storage falls back to the design fixtures. Writes update memory before storage, so the preview still works when the browser denies storage access.

Screens receive records and callbacks through props. Forms collect input, then await `useWorkspace.create`. The source owns persistence and returns the updated workspace. `DashboardApp` closes the form and navigates after success. Failed submissions retain the form and show an error. The timer uses elapsed monotonic time; failed saves keep the stopped duration for retry.

## Adding a screen

Add its route in `routes.ts`, its icon in `sidebar.tsx`, and its component under `dashboard/pages`. Add its render branch in `dashboard-app.tsx`. Keep screen-specific state in that screen. Put a shared component in `ui.tsx` only when more than one screen needs it.

## Backend integration

The source contract is defined in `src/types/workspace.ts`:

```ts
type WorkspaceSource = {
  load: () => Promise<WorkspaceData>;
  create: (kind: ModalKind, values: FormValues) => Promise<WorkspaceData>;
  saveTime: (project: string, seconds: number) => Promise<WorkspaceData>;
};
```

To connect an API, implement these methods and export that implementation as `workspaceSource`. The hook also accepts a source argument for testing. The screens and forms use the same callbacks.

- `load` fetches and validates the workspace collections. Map backend field names and status values to the frontend record types.
- `create` sends the relevant fields for the selected kind and returns the updated workspace. Use server-issued IDs and server validation; local IDs belong only to the browser implementation.
- `saveTime` sends the project and duration, then returns the updated records. Throw on a failed request so the duration remains available for retry.
- Authentication must follow the backend's contract. Keep credentials on the server and never put secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.

The current `main` branch has no endpoints or authentication contract. This PR does not assume endpoint paths, a database, or a session mechanism. For v1 the source returns a workspace snapshot. When collections become large, fetch and paginate them by screen rather than loading every record.

When records come from the server, fetch initial data in route pages and move the corresponding screen rendering there. Keep timer and navigation state in the shared layout. Do not import credentials or server modules into a client hook.

## Working rules

- Keep route definitions in one place. Use Next.js links for navigation.
- Keep record creation out of screen components and formatting out of JSX.
- Use strict TypeScript and typed fixtures. Check stored JSON at runtime.
- Keep styles grouped by responsibility and put breakpoint rules in `responsive.css`.
- Add a helper when it removes repeated behavior. Avoid wrappers that only rename a call.
- Run `npm run check` and verify the affected browser journey before sharing a change.
